### Projects:

1. **Open Source Project with Omdena: Fraud Prediction in Bangladesh (Time Series)**:

   - Description: Collaborated on an open-source project with Omdena to develop a fraud prediction model for Bangladesh. The project focused on time series analysis to detect fraudulent activities in financial transactions.
   - Technologies: Machine Learning, Time Series Analysis, Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost
2. **Library Management System (Python Basics)**:

   - Description: Created a simple library management system to learn the basics of Python programming. The system allows users to manage library inventory, add new books, check availability, and perform basic CRUD operations.
   - Technologies: Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Command-Line Interface (CLI)
3. **Telephone Company Service Churn Prediction**:

   - Description: Implemented a binary classification model to predict customer churn in a telephone company's service. The model analyzes customer data and identifies factors contributing to churn, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain customers.
   - Technologies: Machine Learning, Binary Classification, Python, scikit-learn, Logistic Regression
4. **Fraud Detection in Imbalanced Dataset**:

   - Description: Developed a machine learning model to detect fraud in an imbalanced dataset. The model effectively identifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, providing enhanced security for financial transactions.
   - Technologies: Machine Learning, Imbalanced Dataset Handling, Python, scikit-learn, XGBoost
5. **Cat and Dog Image Classification**:

   - Description: Implemented a deep learning model for classifying images of cats and dogs. The model distinguishes between images of cats and dogs with high accuracy, providing a valuable tool for image classification tasks.
   - Technologies: Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Python, TensorFlow, Keras
6. **NLP Audio QA System**:

   - Description: Developed a natural language processing (NLP) project where users can ask questions based on the context provided in audio format. The system processes the audio input, understands the context, and generates audio responses accordingly.
   - Technologies: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Speech Recognition, Text-to-Speech (TTS), Python, TensorFlow
